# Project Name
Farmworker Wallet OS

# Project Description
The **Farmworker Wallet OS**  project is a community of contribution led by [Entidad](https://www.entidad.io/) and the [United Farm Workers Foundation](https://www.ufwfoundation.org/) (UFWF) with the goal of furthering the adoption of an open, secure, interoperable digital wallet engine that makes it easier for farmworker communities to access an ecosystem of life-altering social and human services. 

  
Farmworkers are the backbone of global food supply chains, yet they remain one of the most underserved segments of our population. While services and programs exist to help, it’s challenging and costly for the farmworker organizations that provide them to securely collect and verify the information needed to prove applicant eligibility claims.  As a result, most farmworkers forego services and resources they need, even though they’re eligible for them.  

 
Over the last three years, Entidad and the UFW Foundation have been exploring digital trust technologies to solve this problem. We’ve developed Preparese<sup>TM</sup>, a digital infrastructure solution that lets farmworker organizations securely reuse verified farmworker information, eliminating the need for repetitive collection. The solution layers didcomm, wallet, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable credential technologies with a low-code application development platform, [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/).  

 
Mendix has been a key component in making the Preparese<sup>TM</sup> solution possible. Low-code software development has been growing in popularity and bringing new audiences to the practice. Mendix, one of the more popular platforms with over 300K active developers and 50M users, has enabled Entidad and the UFW Foundation to develop, launch, and maintain enterprise-grade digital trust enabled solutions that solve real world problems. 

 
We’ve built two products, using this technology. For organizations we’ve built Preparese Platform<sup>TM</sup>, it allows them to quickly develop and launch digital trust enabled services and programs. For farmworkers, we’ve developed Preparese Mobile<sup>TM</sup> which combines a verifiable digital profile with a suite of tools that simplify interactions with organizations on the platform. 

 
The Preparese Platform<sup>TM</sup> is being used by 9 organizations and has 5 digital services in production. The most recent service launched is being used by the 9 organizations to process and distribute [$80 million](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/09/07/usda-invests-700-million-grants-provide-relief-farm-and-food) in one-time relief payments to over 125,000 workers, under the United States Department of Agriculture’s [Farm and Food Workers Relief Program](https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/ffwr) (FFWR).  

  
The second product, Preparese Mobile<sup>TM</sup>, is designed around the unique needs of farmworkers. We’ve developed a react native mobile app that lets farmworkers store, manage, and exchange their verified information. Engagement with organizations is made easier with [DIDComm](https://didcomm.org/book/v2/)-based communication capabilities such as text and video chat.  

 
One of the cornerstone technologies of the solution is an interoperable Mendix enabled digital wallet. The wallet components need to be able to engage with various non-profit, government, and philanthropic sources, each with their own technology stacks. For this reason, interoperability and working with open standard frameworks has been a priority. The project team members have participated in TrustOverIP Foundation, Hyperledger Aries JS Working Group, and various other communities, including the OpenWallet Foundation of late, to ensure we adhere to best practices and standards.       

 
While currently focused on farmworkers, the Mendix digital wallet engine can be used to help others. There are many other underserved communities that could benefit greatly from the privacy, accessibility, and security digital wallets can provide. With this social impact purpose in mind and spirit of further collaboration, Entidad and the UFW Foundation propose to open source the digital wallet engine used in their Preparese<sup>TM</sup> solution. By making these resources available, we hope to facilitate a wide variety of social impact.  

 
Additionally, the project allows us to bridge and advance the interest of both the OpenWallet Foundation and Mendix communities. This project that connects the OpenWallet Foundation efforts and Mendix communities. By tapping into the Mendix developer community, we not only expand the number of digital trust technology practitioners, but we also tap into a community with an established customer base. By making digital wallets components that can be easily integrated into their existing solutions, the project can drive further adoption and usage of interoperable, secure and privacy preserving digital wallets. 

 

##Origin & History 

The origins of the **Farmworker Wallet OS** project align with those of Entidad. What began as a volunteering effort by three college friends, was formalized in 2018 with the founding of Entidad as a public benefit corporation.  We have primarily been working with leading farm worker-serving organizations to develop technology that leverages growing digital literacy in their communities to scale their impact.  

 
The first digital service launched supported the UFW Foundation’s emergency relief efforts during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The solution was used to plan, manage and operate over 500 in-person community events where over $15 million in resources were distributed to over 40K families. Additionally, it has allowed us to better understand the unique challenges of building for underserved communities and why interoperable, secure, and privacy preserving technologies are key to addressing these challenges.
